Github has put a limit on repository sizes - 2GB.
Knowing that, it's too risky to upload the dataset here.
If you want it, contact me at "stefan.s.sotirov.2017@elsys-bg.org".
After you download it, unzip it and copy it in the "/dataset" subdirectories of the solutions directories.
I will, however, put an example of a clean and a dirty container in each "/dataset" directory to show what the image processing algorithms output.
