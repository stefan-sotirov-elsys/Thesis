Github has put a limit on repository sizes - 2GB
Knowing that, it's too risky to upload the dataset here.
If you want it, contact me at "stefan.s.sotirov.2017@elsys-bg.org".
After you download it, unzip it and copy it in the "/dataset" subdirectories of the solutions directories.

Solution 1 - no image processing (Bad learning)
Solution 2 - isolated containers (Good learning)
Solution 3 - detected edges (Not so good but way better than 1)
